MultiChain is a private blockchain platform that can be used to design and implement private or permissioned networks. It is intended to offer an adaptable and flexible framework for creating blockchain applications. This will ensure data security, privacy, and efficient sharing. Multichain is the primary server of this system where patient's data is stored. Another relational database has been used to store offchain data. PostgreSQL has been used for creating and managing the relational database. NextJs 14 has been used to develop the frontend and the backend of the web application. NLP has been used to summarize the patient data for doctor's convenience.
